 4. The 'Project Summary Link' will be your link to access the ATRAC record.
 5. Access the established ATRAC record.
 6. Review the most recent version of the **Request to Archive** record and populate/update the information collecting therein (if needed):
   * _Be sure to only use the 'Save' button when making any changes._
   * _NCEI will make the determination as to when the record should be 'Submitted'._
 7. Review the most recent version of the ISO Metadata record and populate/update the information collecting therein (if needed):
   * _The information collected in this section will directly feed into the metadata for the automated data stream. So, pay careful attention!_
 8. Review the most recent version of the **Data Submission Agreement** and populate/update the information collecting therein (if needed):
   * _This record should be nearly complete by the time you get to it. So, a brief review of the information will suffice._
 9. NCEI will 'Submit' the documentation and it will undergo an internal review process.
 10. Once approved, NCEI will begin to implement the procedure documented in the ATRAC record.
