Determine the web tool for documenting and submitting your dataCurrently,
 NCEI has two web tools to collect information about data sets that are 
intended to be archived within the NCEI archive. The two systems 
facilitate the submission of data through the development of metadata 
records. For one-off submissions (data collections that are not episodically or periodically recurring transactions) the&nbsp;Send2NCEI&nbsp;web tool&nbsp;is recommended for the collection of metadata and transfer of data to the NCEI archive. For automated submissions (data transfer will occur on a consistent basis; weekly, monthly, semi-annually, annually, episodic, etc.)&nbsp;the&nbsp;Advanced Tracking and Resource tool for Archive Collections&nbsp;(ATRAC)&nbsp;web tool&nbsp;is recommended for the collection of metadata and details of the transfer mechanisms that will be developed.&nbsp;Below are some examples to assist in determining which web tool&nbsp;is appropriate for the data that is intended to be archived.Send2NCEI:A Principal Investigator (PI) who has collected data from multiple CTD casts in the North Pacific.An aggregation of data collected from one platform over a year.Hard copies of historical data found stowed away.ATRAC:Buoy collecting continuous data which can be exported on an episodic/periodic occurrence.&nbsp;An automated system that aggregates and exports data on&nbsp;an episodic/periodic&nbsp;basis.A Data Assembly Center (DAC) which can aggregate data and submit on an&nbsp;episodic/periodic&nbsp;basis.Documenting your DataUse the appropriate system,&nbsp;Send2NCEI&nbsp;or&nbsp;ATRAC,&nbsp;to
 begin documenting the data intended to be archived. The information 
collected within the two systems does vary slightly, due to the 
intention of the request for archiving. However, the following 
information would be beneficial to have available when populating the 
appropriate system.First and last dates of data collection;Sea areas where data were collected (e.g., Gulf of Maine)Western
 and eastern longitudinal boundaries and northern and southern 
latitudinal boundaries within which the data were collected;Instrument types used to collect the data (e.g., CTD or XBT);Ocean properties measured (e.g., salinity, temperature, current direction, or dissolved oxygen);Organizations
 that collected the data (e.g., NOAA/NMFS/Northeast Fisheries Science 
Center and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution);Who was involved in processing, documenting and organizing dataPlatforms from which the data were collected (e.g., moored buoy and NOAA ship HENRY B. BIGELOW); andProjects that funded the collection of these data (e.g., World Ocean Circulation Experiment).Developing a record in the appropriate web toolThe&nbsp;Advanced Tracking and Resource tool for Archive Collections&nbsp;(ATRAC) and the&nbsp;Send2NCEI&nbsp;web
 tool facilitate the collection of metadata related to the packages you 
have developed&nbsp;according to the procedures above. &nbsp;Once you 
have collected the pertinent information listed below, it is recommended
 to have that information available when populating the appropriate 
system.An idea of the size of the data files (both individually and as a collection).The frequency you would like to be archiving (weekly, monthly, yearly).Accessible examples of your data files (though a WAF, DAP or other service).Examples of your 'Manifest' files.For more information on populating the ATRAC record, see&nbsp;ATRAC Guidance.&nbsp;To learn more about ATRAC, see Introduction to ATRAC.For more information on populating the Send2NCEI record, contact NCEI.




Posting the Data to be ArchivedFor
 NCEI to be able to develop the appropriate metadata and archive the 
data, the provider should provide a location where NCEI can gain access 
to the data. While developing the location where the files will be 
posted for transfer to the NCEI archive, we recommend the following best
 practices:



Post your consistently
 formatted data files and directory structure to a location (FTP, HTTP, 
DAP, THREDDS, etc) where NCEI can pull the data from.Allow ample time for NCEI to develop the ingest and archival procedures.Verify that the location where the files are posted will not vary throughout the archival process.Anonymous FTP sites are okay for NCEI to pull data from, we just need the appropriate information to gain access.Provide access to the files for approximately one month after the data has been ingested and archived at NCEI.





Monitoring &nbsp;Archival ProceduresOnce
 the archival process has been developed and implemented, some time 
should be devoted to verifying the defined process has been implemented 
correctly. Typically this is accomplished through the development of an 
example metadata record and example Archival Information Package. Once 
the example is approved, we recommend the following checks to verify the
 process is functioning correctly:Search the&nbsp;Geoportal&nbsp;for
 your archived data collection. The metadata records could take up to 
one-day to be indexed in the geoportal, so allow a little bit of leeway.Check at least one of the Archival Information Packages to verify no errors have occurred.Approximately
 one month after you have been notified that a package has been 
archived, you have the flexibility to remove the archived packages from 
your access site. NCEI now has your data archived!


Access Archived DataThe
 NCEI accession number is a 'unique tracking number' for each collection
 of data from a data provider. The NCEI Accession Tracking Data Base 
(ATDB) is a database used by NCEI to keep track of archival collections 
of original data and provide discovery metadata about those collections 
through the NCEI Ocean Archive System (OAS).Use
 the NCEI accession number to search the Ocean Archive System or to 
reference a specific NCEI accession number with this URL:&nbsp;http://data.nodc.noaa.gov/accession/#######&nbsp;(where
 ####### is the NCEI Accession number; multiple NCEI Accession numbers 
may be used in one URL, separated by commas, e.g., 
#######,#######,#######)To search through the&nbsp;Geoportal&nbsp;use the following&nbsp;Geoportal Tips Page&nbsp;to assist in developing the appropriate query.All IOOS Regional Association and Data Assembly Center data will be tagged with the following metadata key:&nbsp;"Integrated Ocean Observing System Data Assembly Centers Data Stewardship Program"&nbsp;(The link directs you to&nbsp;the
 pre-queried geoportal search page for the project "Integrated Ocean 
Observing System Data Assembly Centers Data Stewardship Program".)Top
